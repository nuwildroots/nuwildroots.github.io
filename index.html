			<h4>Who we are:</h4><p>Wild Roots Garden was founded at Northwestern University in the fall of 2009 through a collaboration between the One Book One Northwestern project, three undergraduate environmental student organizations (SEED, ECO, and ESW), Facilities Management, the graduate student garden, and Norris University Center.   Today, Wild Roots is managed by undergraduate students in (grateful) collaboration with Facilities Management.  Our fresh produce is harvested and donated to the chefs in our dining halls as well as to the local community through Campus Kitchens.  We are located on the south lawn of Norris University Center (outside of Norbucks).  Come visit us!</p><h4>Our mission:</h4><p>Our mission is to connect students to the earth and each other, to serve the evolving educational and social needs of the Northwestern community, and to inspire students to think critically about the food we eat by starting conversations about sustainability, social justice, and our food system.  We live our mission by growing fresh produce for the Northwestern and Evanston communities using sustainable practices and by using the garden as an educational tool to empower students to produce their own food, to creatively solve ecological problems, and to share their knowledge with others.  Wild Roots Garden provides a space for students to connect to the land and to each other through workdays, events, and other programming and through the creation of a community of garden stewards.</p><h4>Our stats:</h4><p>In its first growing season (spring to fall 2010), the garden was 500 square feet and produced over 250 pounds of fresh produce. In spring 2012 the garden added 40 raised beds and additional ground space, expanding the garden to its current total of over 1200 square feet of growing space. So far, we have harvested over 300 pounds of produce during the 2013 growing season.</p>
